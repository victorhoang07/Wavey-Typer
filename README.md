Wavey Typer is a typing-based game. With the help of visual and audio cues, the player will be able to quickly recognize mistakes they make or every completed word

The goal of Wavey Typer is aimed towards improving the player's typing speed and accuracy. Through aesthetic visuals and calming music, the player can practice their typing skills in an enjoyable manner. Towards the end of each round, their words per minute (WPM) and other stats will be shown to display their performance.
